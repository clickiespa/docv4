### Endpoint
```
POST /search/metrics
```

### Headers
| Header | Required | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Request body
| Field | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resource_filter` | no | object | No | Scope results to metrics linked through `resource_relationships` when provided. |
| `param_filters` | no | array | No | List of field-level filters that accept the same names allowed in `return_fields` (except `id_resource`). |
| `return_fields` | no | array | No | Subset of fields to return. When a `resource_filter` is present, `id_resource` is always included in the response even if omitted from this list. |
| `limit` | no | int | `100` | Maximum number of records to return. |
| `skip` | no | int | `0` | Offset for pagination. |

#### `resource_filter`
| Field | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resource_type` | yes | string | No | Must be `asset`. |
| `direction` | no | string | `child` | Relationship side to traverse: `parent` to return metrics as parents of the listed resources, `child` (default) to return metrics as children. The relationship join only occurs when `resource_filter` is provided. |
| `operator` | yes | string | No | Comparison operator limited to `in` or `not_in`. |
| `resource_ids` | yes | array | No | IDs applied to the `resource_type` column using the selected operator. The returned `id_resource` matches the values supplied here. |

#### `param_filters` items
| Field | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | yes | string | No | Metric attribute to filter (any valid `return_fields` value except `id_resource`). |
| `operator` | yes | string | No | Comparison operator: `eq`, `not_eq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, `not_in`, `contains`, `like`, `contains_all`, `like_all`, `not_contains`, or `not_like`. |
| `value` | yes | any | No | Literal or list used with the selected operator. |
